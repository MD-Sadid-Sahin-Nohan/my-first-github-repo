    <!--This is the story-->
    <p id="first">On 24 November 2022, we reached Bali, an island in the Indonesian archipelago of the Sunda Islands. We reached 11:45 pm at the airport. Then we went to the hotel, that we booked from Bangladesh.</p>
    <p id="first">After a break we reached at the <strong>Bronze Age</strong>.The most beautiful evidence of this Bronze Age are the famous drums(mokko). It is in Bali that the famous "moon of Péjéng" was discovered in Pura Penataran Sasih. Although it is called a drum, there is no membrane that must be hit. The drum resonates by itself. So it is a real percussion instrument. According to the legend, it is the wheel of the chariot of the goddess of the moon (Sasih means moon) which would have been detached and fallen from the sky.</p>

    <p id="second">Then we went to the bali beach. Such a beautiful place, that i had ever seen.Between the natural elegance, exciting lifestyle and friendly locals, Bali is one of my favourite locations to visit. This volcanic island is a province of Indonesia and sits between the islands of Java and Lombok. As Indonesia’s main tourist destination, Bali is well known for its refined arts, such as modern and traditional dances, sacred temples and pristine natural beauty. The nightlife is another aspect that travellers love! Spending time outdoors is customary in Bali, so remember to bring sunscreen! Especially between May and September when it is the dry season as there will be a lot of sun!</p>
